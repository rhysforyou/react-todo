Just a simple to do list in React that I threw together after reading the official getting started guide. The goal here isn't to write good code so much as it is to ensure the concepts of that intro tutorial sunk in.

That said, this project does use [ESLint](http://eslint.org) to force me into writing well-formatted JavaScript since I _really_ need to be getting better at that. Oh yeah and it uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to lock down dependencies; because I'm a former Ruby developer and the idea of a package manager that doesn't do that hugely bothers me.
